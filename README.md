R statistical programming language for Social Sciences  

Social science research has become more sophisticated in their statistical analysis. Significant gaps exist in combining a gentle introduction to statistical concepts with a analytical concepts that undergird social science analysis.
This collection is an attempt to introduce the beginner social scientist to statistical concepts and programming methods using R, using material and concepts from social science analysis.  

Most of the perspectives and source material will be from economics, but we will not limit ourselves in terms of scope.  

Special attention will be paid to encouraging best practices, maintaining robust code, and reproducability of results.
